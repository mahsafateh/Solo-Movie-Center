                    have reformed into another organization called the Apostles. Under the leadership of a mysterious
                    fundamentalist known only as John Lark, the organization is planning on acquiring three plutonium
                    cores. Ethan and his team are sent to Berlin to intercept them, but the mission fails when Ethan
                    saves Luther and the Apostles escape with the plutonium. With CIA agent August Walker joining the
                    team, Ethan and his allies must now find the plutonium cores before it's too late.</p>
